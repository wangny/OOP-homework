I combine the code source of lab6 and assignment4, make some adjustment to meet the requirements.
I pass the answer user typed to sever, compare answer in sever and broadcast current game stage to each client.


First problem I encounter is facing difficulty in passing varibles through classes, I found it's because I misuse an loop later.
Second problem is that if I run Runnable_sever.jar by double-clicks rather than commend line, it won't show console therefore I can't close it down. But it's okay if I run with commend line.
